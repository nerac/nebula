# Nebula: A github repository manager
Nebula is an application that allows you to manage all your starred repositories on github in a meaningful way. Search, filter, tag or group your repositories so you never miss on that one repository you can't remember.

## Getting Started: 
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start` 
This runs the app in development mode. <br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
